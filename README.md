# Explore_Zync
## Overview    
The aim of this project is to explore features of the xilinx zync z7020 running bare metal. This repository will focus on C source created in the SDK rather than the HDL/bitstream aspect of the project. 
The focus will be primarily on real time control applications and the peripherals commonly used in those applications. 

Further, this repository will serve as an exploration of github.
## Specifics
**Hardware**  
The HW this code is being executed on is a developement board, the Arty z7 from digilent, programmed via usb.
Additional hardware will be added as needed to support the developement of peripheral drivers.

**RTL/Bitstream/VHDL**
A significant portion of the code for this project will be
