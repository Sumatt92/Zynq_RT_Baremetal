## Repostitory Structure
All branches should contain the necessary files to compile a functional program in the SDK. All commits should compile without error in the SDK. Hardware/HDL files should be specified in a text file in the repo (at present this will consist of a reference to a vivado project on my hard drive until I determine the best way to structure and contain all necessary file). This file should be in the repo root. 
The repository should have the following structure for c source code:
* **Root**
   * The Project Directory(p4)
      * Binaries
      * Includes
      * Debug
      * Src
        * main.c
        * platform.c
        * platform.h
        * custom driver source 
        * platform_config.h
        * umbrella initialization source (einit as of 11/23/2018)
            * *Should contain source to allow one-line init of peripherals/hw from the main function*  
        * lscript.ld
        * xilinx.spec
        * all other application source code for this project
   * The bsp directory 
      * *This is generated hw_wrapper, unlikely to be directly modified*
   * The hw_platform_0 directory
      * *This is generated by vivado*
   * The vivado_HDL directory
      * *This should contain screen captures, vivado projects and any other useful files for creating the hardware handoff files*
   * README.md
   * This file
